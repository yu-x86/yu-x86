### About Me
```
I'm a backend software developer and Java is my main language.
I got into programming pretty early because I was always curious about how games worked behind the scenes.
That curiosity led me to mess around with mods, break things, and try to understand the logic underneath -
which eventually pushed me toward backend development.
